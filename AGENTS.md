# Agent Instructions

- Any change with a user-visible effect must include an entry in `docs/changelog.md`.
- Add changelog entries under `## Unreleased` in `docs/changelog.md`.
- Changelog entries should be single bullets in plain language that explain the user-visible effect (not internal refactors).
- If behavior, CLI output/options, or configuration changes, update the relevant docs in `docs/` in the same change.
- Before finishing, run the linting/tests relevant to the files you changed.
